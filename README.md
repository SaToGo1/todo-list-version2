# To-Do List V2
## üìù Description
Effortlessly manage tasks with this to-do list app. Quickly view today's, weekly, and monthly tasks for short and long-term planning. Organize tasks into projects for seamless management.
### About the New Version
In this new version I rebuilt the code using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to craft a codebase that's more maintainable and also well-structured.

Additionally, I introduced new features, including project colors and detailed task information.
